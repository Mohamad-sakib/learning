# Learning Summary: Dependent Clauses

## 1. Dependent Clause

A dependent clause has a subject and a verb but does not express a complete thought. It cannot stand alone.

**Example**:
_Because it was raining_ (incomplete thought)

## 2. Independent Clause

An independent clause is a complete sentence that can stand alone. It expresses a full thought.

**Example**:
_We stayed inside_ (complete thought)

## 3. Subordinating Conjunction

Dependent clauses often start with subordinating conjunctions like "because," "if," "although," "since," etc. These conjunctions make the clause dependent.

**Examples**:
_Because_, _Although_, _Since_, _If_, _When_, _After_

## 4. Dependent + Independent Clause

A dependent clause needs an independent clause to form a complete sentence. The dependent clause explains or adds context to the independent clause.

**Example**:
_Because it was raining, we stayed inside._

## 5. Dependent Clause Alone

A dependent clause by itself is incomplete and should not be used as a sentence.

**Example**:
_Because it was raining._ (incomplete)

## 6. Punctuation

- When a dependent clause comes first, use a comma to separate it from the independent clause.
- If the independent clause comes first, no comma is needed.

**Examples**:

- _Because it was raining, we stayed inside._
- _We stayed inside because it was raining._
