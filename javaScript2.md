# Learnings in JavaScript

## 1. Literals

An expression that evaluates to itself.

## 2. Variable

A memory block that holds data or a data structure.

## 3. Identifiers

Names given to variables, functions, or other elements in JavaScript.

## 4. Expression

A piece of code that evaluates to a value.

## 5. Statements

Instructions that tell JavaScript to perform an action. Unlike expressions, statements don't evaluate to a value, but some statements contain expressions that result in a value.

---

## 6. Control Flow Statements

- **For**
- **While**
- **If-Else**
- **Switch-Case**

---

## 7. String

A sequence or collection of characters in consecutive memory locations. Strings are indexed, immutable, and rich in methods for manipulation.

---

## 8. Block

A block of code that creates its own **scope**, defining what is accessible where.

---

## 9. Functions

A block of code that maps a set of values to others. Use cases include code reusability, abstraction, etc.

---

## 10. String Methods (String Class)

Methods are behaviors of the string classâ€™s objects.

---

## 11. Loops

- **For-of loop**

---

## 12. Recursion

---

## 13. Array

An ordered collection of multiple data types stored in consecutive memory locations. Arrays are indexed, mutable, and rich in methods.

---

## 14. Array Methods (Array Class)

- `push()`, `pop()`, `unshift()`, `shift()`, `splice()`, `indexOf()`, `lastIndexOf()`, `slice()`, `reverse()`, `at()`, `sort()`, `join()`, `fill()`, `concat()`, `includes()`, `keys()`, `values()`

---

## 15. Higher Order Array Methods

- `Map()`, `Filter()`, `Reduce()`, `Every()`, `Some()`, `From()`, `Find()`, `Flat()`, `FlatMap()`

---

## 16. Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy

---

## 17. Classes, Static & Instance Properties and Methods

- **Class**, **Static**, **Instance Properties**
- **Static**, **Instance Methods**

---

## 18. Objects

- **Object**: `{key: value}`
- **Array and Object Spreading**

---

## 19. Object Class and Its Methods

- `keys()`, `values()`, `entries()`

---

## 20. Data Organization

---

## 21. Anonymous Functions

---

## 22. Function as Variable

```javascript
const a = function () {};
```

## 24. Set

---

## 25. Import and Export

---

## 26. Test Cases and Test Framework

---

## 27. Assert Library

- `assertEqual()`

---

## 28. Deno

- `Deno.test()`
- Deno Extension

---

## 29. Refactoring

---

## 30. String Template

---

## 31. Regular Expressions

---

## 32. Cricket Scoreboard Assignment

- Importance of Templates
- When to use Arrays vs Objects
- Searching in Arrays vs finding keys in Objects
- Grouping Data (no need to use it often, but it's a powerful tool)
- Efficient Data Fetching (perform as many queries as possible in one iteration)
- Creating Templates for Objects
- Avoid preparing data in advance until requested
- Importance of Testing
- Testing with `Deno.test()` and the Assert Library

---

## 33. Testing with `description()` and `it()` or `test()` Functions

Creating categories of tests.

---

## 34. Call(), Apply(), Bind()

---

## 35. `this` Keyword

Refers to the calling context.

---

## 36. JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (like XML in Java). Used for storing and transferring data in JavaScript environments.

- **JSON Functions**:
  - `JSON.stringify()`
  - `JSON.parse()`
